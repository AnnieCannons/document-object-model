# Working with the Document Object Model in JavaScript

### The DOM

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface and representation of a structured document. In the context of web development, the DOM specifically refers to the hierarchical, tree-like structure that represents HTML. It provides a way for programs to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents.

### Components of the DOM

1. Structured Representation: The DOM represents an HTML as a structured hierarchy of nodes. Each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or piece of content within the document.

2. Tree-like Structure: The nodes in the DOM are organized in a tree-like structure, where each node can have parent, child, and sibling nodes. This structure reflects the nesting and relationships of elements in the document.


### Activities

1. Open and review the HTML file in this repo. You can open it in the browser to see how it is structured.
2. Draw the Document Object Model for the HTML file. You can do this in Google slides or in another design tool of your choice. Take a screenshot and add the file to this repo.
3. Answer the questions in the scripts file.
